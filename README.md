# What you can expect here
In this repository I will collect jupyter notebook files descibing the basics of several machine learning algorithms. The major purpose of this is for mayself to really understand the algorithms and some theory behind. Additionally, it will give me the chance to learn a new language.

# What you can not expect here
You will not find high performace implementation of the algorithms. I will also do no extensive testing.
