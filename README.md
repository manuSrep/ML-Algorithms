# Machine Learning Algorithms
This is a collection of Machine Learning (ML)-Algorithms I would like to understand in great detail. Therefore I will implement them myself in Julia. The implementations are not intended for productive use but to clearify the method and I will do it as [Jupyter notebook] (http://jupyter.org) files. At the same time this offers me the chance to learn about Julia.

## Regression Algorithms
 - [] Linear regression
 - [] Support Vector Machine (SVM)  Regressor

## Classification Algorithms
  - [] k nearest neighbour (KNN)
  - [] neuran networks (NN)
  - [] decision tree
  - [] random forests
  
  - ### Discriminant Analysis
    - [] linear discriminant analysis
    - [] quadraatic discriminant analysis
   
   - [] Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
